**NOTE!!: This standard is deprecated and was superseeded by [LSP6-KeyManager](https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/main/LSPs/LSP-6-KeyManager.md).**

## Simple Summary
A contract for key management of a blockchain proxy account.

## Abstract
The following describes standard functions for a key manager to be used in conjunction with [ERC725](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/725).
This contract can hold keys to sign actions (transactions, documents, logins, access, etc), as well as execute instructions through an ERC725 proxy account.

## Motivation
This key manager standard allows for more complex management of an [ERC725](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/725) proxy account.


## Definitions

- `keys`: Keys are public keys from either external accounts, or contracts' addresses.
- `claim issuer`: is another smart contract or external account, which issues claims about this identity. The claim issuer can be an identity contract itself.
- `claim`: For details about claims see [#ERC735](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/735)



## Specification


### Key Management

Keys are cryptographic public keys, or contract addresses associated with this identity.
The structure should be as follows:

- `key`: A public key owned by this identity
    - `purpose`: `uint256[]` Array of the key types, like 1 = MANAGEMENT, 2 = EXECUTION
    - `keyType`: The type of key used, which would be a `uint256` for different key types. e.g. 1 = ECDSA, 2 = RSA, etc.
    - `key`: `bytes32` The public key. // for non-hex and long keys, its the Keccak256 hash of the key


```js
struct Key {
    uint256[] purposes;
    uint256 keyType;
    bytes32 key;
}
```

#### getKey

Returns the full key data, if present in the identity.

``` js
function getKey(bytes32 _key) external view returns(uint256[] purposes, uint256 keyType, bytes32 key);
```

#### keyHasPurpose

Returns `TRUE` if a key is present and has the given purpose. If the key is not present it returns `FALSE`.

``` js
function keyHasPurpose(bytes32 _key, uint256 purpose) external view returns(bool exists);
```


#### getKeysByPurpose

Returns an array of public key bytes32 held by this identity.

``` js
function getKeysByPurpose(uint256 _purpose) external view returns(bytes32[] keys);
```


#### addKey

Adds a `_key` to the identity. The `_purpose` specifies the purpose of the key. Initially, we propose four purposes:

- `1`: MANAGEMENT keys, which can manage the identity
- `2`: EXECUTION keys, which perform executions in this identity's name (signing, logins, transactions, etc.)

MUST only be done by keys of purpose `1`, or the identity itself. If it's the identity itself, the approval process will determine its approval.

**Triggers Event:** [KeyAdded](#keyadded)

``` js
function addKey(bytes32 _key, uint256 _purpose, uint256 _keyType) returns (bool success)
```


#### removeKey

Removes `_key` from the identity.

MUST only be done by keys of purpose `1`, or the identity itself. If it's the identity itself, the approval process will determine its approval.

**Triggers Event:** [KeyRemoved](#keyremoved)

``` js
function removeKey(bytes32 _key, uint256 _purpose) returns (bool success)
```


#### changeKeysRequired

Changes the keys required to perform an action for a specific purpose. (This is the *n* in an *n of m* multisig approval process.)

MUST only be done by keys of purpose `1`, or the identity itself. If it's the identity itself, the approval process will determine its approval.

**Triggers Event:** [KeysRequiredChanged](#keysrequiredchanged)

``` js
function changeKeysRequired(uint256 purpose, uint256 number) external
```


#### getKeysRequired

Returns number of keys required for purpose.

``` js
function getKeysRequired(uint256 purpose) external view returns(uint256)
```


--------------------------------------------------------

### Identity usage


#### execute

Passes an execution instruction to the keymanager.
SHOULD require `approve` to be called with one or more keys of purpose `1` or `2` to approve this execution.

Execute COULD be used as the only accessor for `addKey`, `removeKey` and `replaceKey` and `removeClaim`.

**Returns `executionId`:** SHOULD be sent to the `approve` function, to approve or reject this execution.

**Triggers Event:** [ExecutionRequested](#executionrequested)
**Triggers on direct execution Event:** [Executed](#executed)

``` js
function execute(address _to, uint256 _value, bytes _data) returns (uint256 executionId)
```


#### approve

Approves an execution or claim addition.
This SHOULD require `n` of `m` approvals of keys purpose `1`, if the `_to` of the execution is the identity contract itself, to successfully approve an execution.
And COULD require `n` of `m` approvals of keys purpose `2`, if the `_to` of the execution is another contract, to successfully approve an execution.

**Triggers Event:** [Approved](#approved)
**Triggers on successfull execution Event:** [Executed](#executed)
**Triggers on successfull claim addition Event:** [ClaimAdded](#claimadded)

``` js
function approve(uint256 _id, bool _approve) returns (bool success)
```


--------------------------------------------------------


### Events


#### KeyAdded

MUST be triggered when `addKey` was successfully called.

``` js
event KeyAdded(bytes32 indexed key, uint256 indexed purpose, uint256 indexed keyType)
```


#### KeyRemoved

MUST be triggered when `removeKey` was successfully called.

``` js
event KeyRemoved(bytes32 indexed key, uint256 indexed purpose, uint256 indexed keyType)
```



#### ExecutionRequested

MUST be triggered when `execute` was successfully called.

``` js
event ExecutionRequested(uint256 indexed executionId, address indexed to, uint256 indexed value, bytes data)
```


#### Executed

MUST be triggered when `approve` was called and the execution was successfully approved.

``` js
event Executed(uint256 indexed executionId, address indexed to, uint256 indexed value, bytes data)
```


#### Approved

MUST be triggered when `approve` was successfully called.

``` js
event Approved(uint256 indexed executionId, bool approved)
```


#### KeysRequiredChanged

MUST be triggered when `changeKeysRequired` was successfully called.

``` js
event KeysRequiredChanged(uint256 purpose, uint256 number)
```



## Rationale
This specification was chosen to allow most flexibility and experimentation around verifiable accounts. By having a separate contract as proxy on chain allows for cross greater compatibility, as well as extra and altered functionality for new use cases.

### Solidity Interface
```js
pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

contract ERC734 {

    uint256 constant MANAGEMENT_KEY = 1;
    uint256 constant EXECUTION_KEY = 2;

    event KeyAdded(bytes32 indexed key, uint256 indexed purpose, uint256 indexed keyType);
    event KeyRemoved(bytes32 indexed key, uint256 indexed purpose, uint256 indexed keyType);
    event ExecutionRequested(uint256 indexed executionId, address indexed to, uint256 indexed value, bytes data);
    event Executed(uint256 indexed executionId, address indexed to, uint256 indexed value, bytes data);
    event Approved(uint256 indexed executionId, bool approved);
    event KeysRequiredChanged(uint256 purpose, uint256 number);

    struct Key {
        uint256 purpose; //e.g., MANAGEMENT_KEY = 1, EXECUTION_KEY = 2, etc.
        uint256 keyType; // e.g. 1 = ECDSA, 2 = RSA, etc.
        bytes32 key;
    }

    function getKey(bytes32 _key) public external view returns(uint256[] purposes, uint256 keyType, bytes32 key);
    function keyHasPurpose(bytes32 _key, uint256 _purpose) public external view returns (bool exists);
    function getKeysByPurpose(uint256 _purpose) public external view returns (bytes32[] keys);
    function addKey(bytes32 _key, uint256 _purpose, uint256 _keyType) public returns (bool success);
    function removeKey(bytes32 _key, uint256 _purpose) public returns (bool success);
    function changeKeysRequired(uint256 purpose, uint256 number) external;
    function getKeysRequired(uint256 purpose) external view returns(uint256);
    function execute(address _to, uint256 _value, bytes _data) public returns (uint256 executionId);
    function approve(uint256 _id, bool _approve) public returns (bool success);
}
```
