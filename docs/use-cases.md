| Project | Use case description |
| --- | --- |
| [Universal Page](https://universal.page/) | The first marketplace and profile page editor for LUKSO. Almost every token drop is distributed and announced on this platform. The service comes with a feed, showing the latest news of transactions, sales, and listings, and even metrics. It also comes with metrics and stats for all assets, that people can browse through. To see owned assets, the platform has its own customizable page system where people can design a webpage containing all their Universal Profile information. |
| [TradeUP!](https://www.tradeup.live/) | Smart-contract secured escrow swaps, where users can trade LSP7 & LSP8 tokens between Universal Profiles on LUKSO. You can batch multiple tokens together within one trade, against another batch or single token. You can also propose/offer trades to certain Universal Profiles, and analyze historical trades. |
| [universalprofile.cloud](https://universalprofile.cloud/) | Search through platform independent blockchain accounts on LUKSO, or create your own Universal Profile! |
| [upturn](https://upturn.live/) | Upturn is a token creation tool that allows creators and brands to generate LSP tokens on LUKSO and distribute them to their fans and community. The goal is to make token deployment and adding custom functionality like royalties as easy as possible. |
| [SigmaSwap](https://app.sigmaswap.io/en) | First DeFi Bridge between LUKSO and Ethereum, delivering wrapped LYX on Ethereum. The bridge tool will extend support to Base and Astar chains, as well as deliver wUSDT on the LUKSO network, expected to be the first stable coin. |
| [Universal Grave](https://universalgrave.com/) | Universal Grave allows users to set up a Grave for all unwanted token they receive to their Universal Profile. Incoming assets are then automatically forwarded into the Graveâ€™s smart contract. Users can still recover quality assets back to the UP, and soon directly list assets from their Grave for auction. |
| [Stakingverse](https://app.stakingverse.io/) | Stakingverse provides another non-custodial staking pool on LUKSO. Users can withdraw your tokens at any time, even directly from the smart-contract. |
