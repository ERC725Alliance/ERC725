NOTE: some implementation use the old version [ERC725v1](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/ede8c26a77eb1ac8fa2d01d8743a8cf259d8d45b/EIPS/eip-725.md).

| Project | Use case description |
| --- | --- |
| [Origin](https://www.originprotocol.com/en) | Origin Protocol is using ERC725 as the foundation for users' identities on Origin. ERC725 was chosen to maximize interoperability with other projects and Dapps in the future. Origin users have public profiles with attestations for things like email, phone number, and social media accounts. |
| [Caelum Labs](https://caelumlabs.com/) | Caelum Labs plans to use ERC725 as a basic Local/National ID system for Ethereum based Blockchains. Our main goal is to use it to stablish trust between people, companies and public administration, so Smart Contracts can be used for any process between them |
| [Hydro](https://hydrogenplatform.com/hydro) | Hydro plans to provide a platform layer to facilitate and improve aspects of the dApp development process, including identity management. Accordingly, Hydro plans to offer developers a standard implementation of ERC725 in conjunction with other identity standards that can meet the specific needs of their applications. These identity standards are detailed in the [ERC 1484 reference repo](https://github.com/hydrogen-dev/ERC-1484). |
| [Wyre](https://www.sendwyre.com/) | Compatibility with ERC-725 & 735 into our on-chain verification contracts. Our implementation is for bridging the gap between the off-chain _regulated_ entities in Fintech, & the on-chain DeFi products/services today and in the future. Aimed to ensure extensibility given the permutations with verification based on Product/Service / Scale / Geography / etc... We've tested, but aim to be deploying 725 as an additional choice when the account has opted in for an on-chain verification token. This would be via our API, or via direct user-onboarding on Wyre's UI. As a regulated entity, we're planning on supporting 735, aimed at supporting progress toward on-chain verification. Less attack vectors for information, means mitigating security risks made possible with developer barriers to entry getting reduced more rapidly as the ecosystem matures. *Our proposal:* [ERC-DeFi Verification repo](https://github.com/sendwyre/yes-compliance-token/tree/master/docs) includes our ERC, full implementation/tests, an ELI5, DeFi licensing dictionary/terminology and more. |
| [LydianID](https://lydianid.lydianventures.com/product/) | LydianVentures is using ERC725/735 identities and attestations on several projects and created LydianID as an identity management Dapp. LydianID is currently being used by academic institutions to certify on blockchain the studies of their students, who can share the attestation with others. ERC725/735 identities are used in other projects where interoperability among several parties is required and a role-permission system is built with attestations. |
| [Smilo](https://www.smilo.io) | Smilo is using ERC725 identities and off-chain claims including Facial Biometrics. Our first implementation contains festival/opera/stadion facial authentication based on a DID + ticketnumber. We want to collaborate on a global standard to make interoperability work, and PII is shared in a secure way. |
| [LUKSO](https://lukso.network/) | LUKSO is a Blockchain infrastructure, providing a series of standards and solutions for physical and digital consumer goods, in order to foster transparency, circularity and new forms of responsible production and consumption. The [LSP Universal Profile smart contracts](https://github.com/lukso-network/lsp-universalprofile-smart-contracts) use ERC725. |
