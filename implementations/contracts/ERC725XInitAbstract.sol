/**
 * @title Inheritable Proxy Implementation of ERC725 X Executor
 * @author Fabian Vogelsteller <fabian@lukso.network>
 * @dev Implementation of a contract module which provides the ability to call arbitrary functions at any other smart contract and itself,
 * including using `delegatecall`, `staticcall` as well creating contracts using `create` and `create2`
 * This is the basis for a smart contract based account system, but could also be used as a proxy account system
