 * @title Deployable Proxy Implementation of ERC725 X Executor

 * @dev Implementation of a contract module which provides the ability to call arbitrary functions at any other smart contract and itself,
 * including using `delegatecall`, `staticcall` as well creating contracts using `create` and `create2`
 * This is the basis for a smart contract based account system, but could also be used as a proxy account system
