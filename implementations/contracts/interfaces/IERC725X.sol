 * @title The interface for the ERC725X sub-standard, a generic executor.

 * It allows to use different type of message calls to interact with addresses such as `call`, `staticcall` and `delegatecall`.
 * It also allows to deploy and create new contracts via both the `create` and `create2` opcodes.
 * This is the basis for a smart contract based account system, but could also be used as a proxy account system.
