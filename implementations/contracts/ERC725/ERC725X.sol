/**
 * @title ERC725 X executor
 * @dev Implementation of a contract module which provides the ability to call arbitrary functions at any other smart contract and itself,
 *      including using `delegatecall`, `staticcall`, as well creating contracts using `create` and `create2`.
 *
 * This is the basis for a smart contract based account system, but could also be used as a proxy account system.
 *
 * `execute` MUST only be called by the owner of the contract set via ERC173.
